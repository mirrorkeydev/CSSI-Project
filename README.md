# CSSI-Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS WEB APP?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This web app was created as a final project of a 3-week summer program called
Google CSSI. For 3 weeks we learned how to use html, css, javascript, and google
appengine. This web app is the culmination of our knowledge from this program.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY USE THIS WEB APP?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This web app was built with the purpose to create playlists between your friends
by creating a new playlist containing songs that both you and your friend likes
in one of your playlists.

Imagine this, you are going on a road trip with a friend. To make the drive less
boring, you two agree to create a road trip playlist. However, both of you guys
have differing music taste. You like jazz while your friend likes to listen to
hard rock. What are you going to do? Use this web app of course.
