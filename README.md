What Is This Web App?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This web app was primarily built to find the artists and songs that two playlists
have in common. After passing in only the two URLs of the playlists, it displays:

-) an individual analysis of each playlist

-) the artists and songs that the playlists have in common

The web app was created as the final project of CSSI, Google's three-week intensive
summer program. The camp teaches HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Git, and Google
App Engine. The analysis of the playlists, API calls, and templating are all done 
in Python, using the Requests library for the API calls and the 
Jinja2 library for templating.

Why Use This Web App?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This web app was designed with use between friends in mind. Assuming each friend
has a large enough playlist of songs they like (we recommend having upwards of 500 songs for optimal
matching), and their song preferences aren't too polar, the web app can find songs
both friends enjoy. Ideal for everything from road trips to general hangouts.
